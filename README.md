# The Pointless Introduction

Hey There.

I am **BarelySyntax** The Compiled and Copylefter obviously, (though i must apologize from the overwhelming verbosity)

# WARNING EXTREME VERBOSITY

I like to compile, for both C/C++ projects obviously. 
How to reach me? simple. You simply don't, just let it be.
Am i pathetic? Yes. I can barely write correct syntax, as my name suggests.
I use linux, arch and gentoo, however, i don't brag about my distro installations, i call that cowardly behavior. I don't care what distro you use, as long as it stays out of my way.
I extremely hate shortcuts, and will get aggressive. I see it as a de-evolvement of language.
I am neutral, that simply means. I treat the surrounding people with the same default privileges.
The profile picture is intentionally low resolution.
