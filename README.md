### The Pointless Introduction

Hey There.

I am **BarelySyntax** The Compiled and Copylefter obviously, (though i must apologize from the overwhelming verbosity)

#### WARNING EXTREME VERBOSITY

* I like to compile, for both C/C++ projects obviously. 
* How to reach me? simple. You simply don't, just let it be.
* Am i pathetic? Yes. I can barely write correct syntax, as my name suggests.
* I use linux, arch and gentoo, however, i don't brag about my distro installations, i call that cowardly behavior. I don't care what distro you use, as long as it stays out of my way.
* I extremely hate shortcuts, and will get aggressive. I see it as a de-evolvement of language.
* I am neutral, that simply means. I treat the surrounding people with the same default privileges.
* The profile picture is intentionally low resolution.

#### LEXICAL SPECIFICATIONS & PROTOCOL DEFINITIONS (v1.0.0)

To avoid ambiguity regarding my stance on language, please adhere to the following definitions:

* **SECTION 1: SHORTCUTS (RESTRICTED)** Any instance where a standard linguistic unit (a "word") is subjected to lossy compression for the sake of input throughput (e.g., using "u" to represent the second-person pronoun, or "omw" to indicate displacement). I classify this as a failure of the human parser and a degradation of the communication buffer. Detection of such tokens will result in immediate loss of interest or aggressive recalibration of the conversation.

* **SECTION 2: EXPRESSIONS (PERMITTED)** Character-based glyphs and ASCII-based state logs (e.g., "XDD", ":-)", or ">_>") are classified as Metadata. These are not "shortcuts" as they do not replace existing lexical units; rather, they provide necessary context for the current execution state (amusement, skepticism, etc.). These are valid transmissions.
